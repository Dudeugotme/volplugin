## Contiv Storage Release <version>

Contiv Storage is the all-singing, all-dancing volumes system for Swarm and
Mesos. It provides a locking and policies subsystem for all volume types
including Ceph and NFS. The locking subsystem is used to ensure that two of the
same volume cannot be scheduled at the same time, while the policies system is
used to enforce volume compliance. Contiv Storage is best suited to large
clusters and labs.

This beta release version of Contiv Storage brings the latest features and
bugfixes.
